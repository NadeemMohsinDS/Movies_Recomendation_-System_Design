### Movie Recommendation System using Python

This repository contains pre-built code and algorithms for a movie recommendation system developed in Python. The system leverages machine learning concepts comprehensively, focusing on feature engineering using PorterStemmer and cosine_similarity.

#### Features:
- **PorterStemmer:** Utilized for stemming words in the movie descriptions to improve the efficiency of the recommendation engine.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Used for feature engineering to compute similarity between movies based on their descriptions or features.

#### Key Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Includes cleaning and preprocessing of the movie dataset, including using PorterStemmer for text normalization.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Utilizes cosine_similarity to calculate similarity between movies based on their features or descriptions.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Implements various machine learning models for recommendation, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

#### Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the recommendation system: `python main.py`
